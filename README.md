# task_manager
Welcome to my funny little project! I made this in a little over a day just to learn some python skills, especially how to interact with csv files!

It's basically a 'reminders' terminal app for storing and moving tasks between 'important', 'general' and 'completed' lists and uses csv files to store each list.

Suggested by experienced github user 'huitingloke'

## overview
- main.py: the executable script that houses relative filepaths and runs the program. Feel free to change the relative filepaths if you want to store your lists somewhere else or change their filenames.
- taskmanager.py: the file that houses the TaskManager class which basically contains the entire program.

## how to use
1. keep the files in the same directory. The script will automatically create a 'lists' folder with csv files in the same directory as itself on first startup.
2. Run 'main.py' in the terminal. You will be shown a list of the available operations, add an item to get started!
3. If you get stuck, you can force close the program without losing data, as it is saved in the csv files.
4. feel free to find ways to break it and let me know how it can be improved.
